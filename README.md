# Demy API – RESTful Backend (Spring Boot)

This repository contains the **backend API** of the **Demy** project, developed in **Java 21 with Spring Boot**.  
The goal is to provide RESTful services for user management, authentication, and functionalities related to the academic project.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Java 21**
- **Maven Wrapper (`./mvnw`)**
- (Optional) **Docker** if you want to run external dependencies (DB, etc.)

### Run locally
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/<org>/<repo>.git
cd <repo>

# Run with Maven
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The API will be available at: `http://localhost:8080`

## Main structure
- `src/main/java` → application source code.
- `src/test/java` → unit and integration tests.
- `docs/` → extended documentation (architecture, ADRs, API, diagrams, guides).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` → contribution rules (commits, branches, PRs, code style).

## Architecture – Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

The project follows **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles adapted to an academic context.

- Each **module** corresponds to a **bounded context**, with its own logic, models, and layers.
- Example modules:
    - `iam`: identity and access management
    - `institution`: institution management
- The `shared` module contains **common components** (e.g., exceptions, utilities) and is not considered a bounded context.

Each context follows a layered architecture pattern:

```
institution/
├─ application/       # Use cases (services)
├─ domain/            # Domain models
├─ infrastructure/    # Technical implementations (repositories, external services)
└─ interfaces/        # REST controllers, mappers
```

An example of the **domain model** for the `institution` context:

## Workflow
- Main branches:
    - `main` → stable releases (e.g., TB1, TP1, TB2, TF1).
    - `develop` → integration of new features.
- Support branches:
    - `feature/<topic>` → new features or improvements.
    - `hotfix/<topic>` → critical fixes in production.
    - `release/vX.Y.Z` → release preparation (we use **Semantic Versioning**).
