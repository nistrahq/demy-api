Older versions or tags are not maintained.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

When reporting, please include:
- A description of the issue and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.

- Suggested mitigation or fix (if known).

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **48 hours** and aim to provide an initial assessment within **5 working days**.

## Scope
This policy applies to:
- The backend RESTful API (Java / Spring Boot).
- Configurations and deployment instructions provided in this repository.
- API contracts (OpenAPI) and documentation.

This policy does **not** apply to:
- External dependencies (report directly to their maintainers).
- Local development environment issues unrelated to production use.
- Academic reports or classroom feedback (should be handled via the course platform).

## Responsible Disclosure
